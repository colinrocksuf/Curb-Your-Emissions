# Curb Your Emissions

# Product Vision
Our product is designed for students and educators who want to learn about (or
teach!) the benefits of renewable energy and the dangers of the harmful
emissions conventional power-production methods create. Curb your Emissions
is a game that is enjoyable and educates people about topics and issues
pertaining to power consumption. Our product will educate people using actual
data of Florida power consumption. Our product will be intuitive and require no
prior experience with games to get familiar with and play.

# Product Description
The game will be a 2D tycoon-like game requiring the management of resources in order to generate enough power to win the game (power the state) before reaching a certain level of emissions (avoid permanent ecological damage). It contains different sprites (power sources), each of which will increase three counters: gold (money), emissions, and power generated by varying amounts depending on the cost, efficiency, and type of each power source. These values will be loosely based on real data, but also streamlined so that any user can understand and play the game without hassle.
